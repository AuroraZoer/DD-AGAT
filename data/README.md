# Data Pre-processing

## Requirement

`StanfordCoreNLP` is required to obtain the dependency trees for all dataset. Please download version [3.9.2](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/history.html) and put the folder `stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05` under the current directory.

## Data Acquisition and Pre-processing

Follow the steps below to download the dataset from the official website and prepare it for further analysis:

1. Download the dataset from the official source. (Please provide the specific website or source link here.)
2. Perform pre-processing on the downloaded dataset to convert it into the required `sample_data` format.

## Dependency Tree Extraction

Use the provided script `data_processes.sh` to extract dependency trees for the dataset. Follow these steps:

1. Run the `data_processes.sh` script, which automates the extraction process.
2. This script will generate the necessary dependency trees that are crucial for subsequent analysis.
